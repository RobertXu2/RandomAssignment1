      <h2>Future Plans For My Career</h2>
      <p>
        In the future, I want to work in the field of computing, especially as an UX/UI designer
        if possible. There are still many skills and softwares I need to learn such as Figma, Abobe Creative Cloud, InVision, 
        as well as improving my skills with Javascript. I plan to do some certificates in the future and then start designing my 
        portfolio as well as creating better projects as I will need to begin searching for internships for the diploma of IT. 
      </p>

      <h2>Gaining Practical Experience/Internships</h2>
      <p>
        An important step is gaining practical experience through internships, clubs, freelance work etc. 
        Learning from professionals and receiving feedback on my work will help me stay up to date with current 
        and prove my skills continuously.

      <h2>The Near Future</h2>
      <p>
       In the near future I want to complete a certificate for ITIL and then study for a COMPTIA A+ to 
       try to get experience with IT helpdesk or an IT job in general. It would take me around half a year to study 
       for this certificate so I would have to start after university assignments are finished.
