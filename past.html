      <h2>Making YouTube Videos</h2>
      <p>
        During my free time, I created and uploaded Roblox videos to YouTube.
        This was back in Year 10, I interacted with technology softwares such as
        Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop etc to edit videos. The channel is now
        inactive but the highest video reached close to 
        <!-- SPAN CLASS HIGHLIGHT HERE -->
        <span class="highlight">100k views</span>. It also
        taught me how to engage with viewers and manage a small YouTube channel.

      <h2>Writing My First Line Of Code</h2>
      <p>
        My first experience with coding was in Roblox using Roblox Lua. I
        created a small game which, although now inactive, reached over 
         <!-- SPAN CLASS HIGHLIGHT HERE -->
        <span class="highlight">50k visits</span>.
        ; a huge milestone for me at the time. I went on to create other
        games that were not as successful, but each one taught me something new.
        Through this, I learned how to write and structure Lua scripts for game
        mechanics, as well as fundamental programming concepts such as loops,
        conditionals, and events.

      <h2>HSC Life</h2>
      <p>
        During my HSC years, I chose subjects which I throught were 'fun' which was probably
        not the best idea. The subjects I chose were Standard English, Standard Math, Ancient History,
        Biology, and PDHPE. My favourite subject was probably Ancient History with how much there was to
        learn, but it was also the most tedious to study because the content was nearly infinite and memorising 
        essays and sources was hard for me. My favourite topic was probably Egypt: Hatshepsut and studying her 
        erasure from history.

        You might be wondering what led me into doing IT? To be honest I do not really know as well. But since I 
        picked it I have been interested in front end web development as well as UX/UI design.
